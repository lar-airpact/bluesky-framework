# Test Description
#
# This is a test of the BlueSky Framework using SmartFire2 data.
# It runs hundreds of fires through: fuel loading, consumption, and emissions.
#
# For the purposes of testing, it was decided that a SmartFire2 data stream
# would be created specifically for tests. As indicated below, this test
# uses that data stream. And this SmartFire2 data stream should only be used
# in testing cases.
